##################### EXPLANATIONS #####################

res_name	=	Name of the residues that are to be removed.

first_atom	=	Name of the first atom of the residue in the .gro file.
			This atom is used to determine whether the whole residue 
			is inside the membrane or not.

res_size	=	Number of the atoms in that residue. 

lipid_name	=	Name of the membrane lipid.

lim_atom	=	The atom of the residue lipid_name that is used to calculate
			the average z component of the upper and the lower leaflets.

adjust_low	=	Manual adjusting of lower leaflet. Positive number moves the 
			border closer to the middle of the membrane.

adjust_high	=	Manual adjusting of upper leaflet. Positive number moves the 
			border closer to the middle of the membrane.
